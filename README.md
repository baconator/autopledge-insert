# Grand Plan
* Use [BEAR](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) to generate a compilation database.
* Run an analysis over that in order to determine what capabilities are used in which symbols.
* Annotate all implicated files with the computed pledge statements.

# Usage (eventually)
* ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Just discovered bear, so lets just see what arises organically.

# Building
* `mkdir build`
* `cd build`
* `cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ../src`
* `make`
